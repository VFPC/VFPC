# VFPC Plugin

**Applies to VFPC v2.x, available [here](https://github.com/hpeter2/VFPC). Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding v3.x. Please be aware that (v3.x) development is ongoing and file formats may change without notice.**
 
VFPC (Vatsim Flugplan-RFL checker) is a plugin for EuroScope that checks defined departure restrictions on filed flight plans. It adds a Tag Item type for the Departure List, which displays the result of the check.

## Features:
- Tag item VFPC: Shows check-result as green 'OK!' or red 'FPL!' ('SID' = No valid SID found, 'ENG' = Failed Engine type restriction, 'E/O' = Failed even/odd Flightlevel, 'MIN' = Failed minimum Flight Level, 'MAX' = Failed maximum Flightlevel)
- Tag function 'Check FP': Explains the check-result in chat output
- Chat command '.vfpc reload': reload the Sid.json config
- Chat command '.vfpc check': checks currently selected AC and outputs result
- Restrictions customizable in Sid.json config
- Checks Even/Odd Flightlevel restriction
- Checks Minimum & Maximum Flightlevel restriction
- Check condition 'route must contain airway' available
- Check condition 'destination must be' available
- Check condition 'aircraft type must be' available (? - unknown, P - piston, T - turboprop/turboshaft, J - jet, E - electric)

## How to use:
- Load up the plugin
- Add Tag Item type & function to Departure List
- Extend the 'Sid.json' config file

### How to define configurations
The 'Sid.json'-File is using the JSON file format. Each airport is an object containing the "icao" and a sub-object "sids", which contains all definitions & restrictions. Inside this sub-object are all available SIDs defined by the first route waypoint (i.e. "AMLUH" for AMLUH1B, AMLUH9C, AMLUH9D & AMLUH9G).
Each SID can contain multiple objects with defined options based on restrictions. The plugin will stop at the first matching one from top-to-bottom, so the most restrictive objects should always be on top.

Available restrictions:
- "destinations" - Array of strings. The object only applies to FPL with one of the given destination ICAOs. Partials are possible, ex. "ED"
- "engine" - Either string or array of strings. The object only applies to AC with one of the given Engine Types. Options are "P" (piston), "T" (turboprop/turboshaft), "J" (jet) and "E" (electric), as defined by Euroscope
- "navigation" - A string which contains the equipment codes which defines all allowed capabilities for the SID
- "airways" - Array of strings. The object only applies to FPL if route contains any of the given airways

Available options:
- "direction" - String. The FPL must have this E/O option as final flightlevel. Available: "EVEN/ODD/ANY)
- "min_fl" - Integer. The FPL must have this flightlevel as minimum
- "max_fl" - Integer. The FPL must have this flightlevel as maximum

Examples can be found in the given Sid.json file.
